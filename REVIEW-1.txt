Comments for Author
This paper concerns automated proving using knowledge of the category and its theoretical foundation. The authors provide a new algorithm and an executable program. This seems a nice subject, so I recommend the paper for publication in AIMS. 

I just mention some misprints or some words need an explaination as follows.

    line 30: scriptF
    line 31: andFor

Page 3,
    Why formula 3.1?
    What is On>=1 in formula 3.2?

The authors should check through the paper and explain that symbol in the first time it appears.
